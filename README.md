# surge-sniper

Optimizes Pet Simulator 99 Hacker Key farming by teleporting to surge zones when they are announced.

By nibbiebrownie and inspired by A Basement

Lots of code was reused from A Basement's DeepPool and Multi Macros, thank you.

READ THIS README IT HAS HELPFUL INFORMATION

### Cool Features
- Autoreconnect brings you back to the previous surge zone
- cool transparent red box
- Gets rid of stupid cat
- Thats it 

## IMPORTANT NOTES FOR RUNNING THIS SCRIPT
- THE SCRIPT WILL NOT IMMEDIATELY "work", YOU NEED TO WAIT UNTIL A NEW SURGE IS ANNOUNCED FOR IT TO TAKE EFFECT.
- Unzip the folder, double click the surge-sniper-v1.ahk file, use the gui and read this readme
- Click positions are designed for a 1920x1080p screen. Roblox should be be the largest window size, but NOT fullscreen. Taskbar and window borders showing.
- Area routes are designed for the **default camera position** when loading into a server. To correctly align your camera position, load into a server, do not move your camera, and teleport to any hacker zone.
- AFTER clicking the "Enable Macro" button, **press f3 to start the script.**
- Press f6 to pause/unpause
- f8 to exit the script entirely
- **Lower graphics settings work best**, as it eliminates screen clutter making it easier to recognize text.
- The detection box is the section of your screen that is being searched for text. Don't make this TOO big, as it adds screen clutter. It accidentally thought a magnet flag was the matrix zone, so avoid magnet flags if you can.
- Similarly to A Basement's scripts, **to set a position**, click the corresponding "S" button and then press control and click where you'd like to set that position.
-   If you are getting a ton of items, I suggest turning off item notifications.


  ## BUGS
 - If a lot is going on visually, it may not detect a new surge area. If this happens a lot, lower your graphics settings, adjust your camera zoom/position (if adjusting position you may have to adjust routes) and adjust the detection box. If it keeps happening AFTER doing those things, let me know on discord. I have some ideas to (hopefully) greatly improve accuracy, but I haven't had too many accuracy issues so far
- Autoreconnect will not ALWAYS return you to the proper surge zone. This happens if you do not rejoin the same server, the surge zone ended, the surge zone moved. It will bring you back once the next surge activates. I'm confident I can make it always bring you to the correct zone, but it'll take me a bit to implement. 


Let me know if you are having any bugs, this script is definitely not perfect but I'd like to make it the best it can be. I haven't done much long-term testing, so hopefully it works well. I have a few more things I want to do, autoflag, increase accuracy, etc. 

# GUI DEMO

Demo doesn't show the script running because I got tired of waiting for a new surge only to mess up my recording somehow.
